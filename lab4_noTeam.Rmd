### Notes:
* Turnover FF, FR, and INT are rare

# ISU Defense Against Iowa and Notre Dame

    geom_point(alpha=.1) +
    ggtitle("Solo Tackles by Player by Game") +
    xlab("Iowa Solo Tackles") +

### Notes:
* Players seemed to have more Solo_Tackles vs. Notre Dame

  ggplot(aes(x=score)) +
  geom_boxplot(width=.5) +
  ylim(-1,1) +

```

### Notes:
* Purdy's the outlier. He's pretty damn good.

  mutate(YearScoreDiff = score.2019 - score.2018) %>%
  distinct(Name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(-YearScoreDiff) %>%
  select(Name, YearScoreDiff)
```

### Notes:
* Brock, DesHaunte, Charlie, and Tarique had the biggest improvements in score!
